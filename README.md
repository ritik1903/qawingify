### Stack Use
* Programming Language - Python
* Testing Framework  - Selenium WebDriver
* For testing various packages used.

### Generates HTML - REPORT
* Open your command-line interface, navigate to the directory where your Python file is located, and run the Python file using the following command:
```bash
python your_file_name.py
```
* This will execute the tests defined in your Python file and generate an HTML report named "report.html" in the same directory.
* Once the test execution is complete, you can open the generated "report.html" file in a web browser to view the HTML report. The report will contain detailed information about the test execution, including test results, assertions, and any failures or errors encountered during the tests.
